# Bedrock Storybook
This is an initial pass at adding full storybook coverage to bedrock. All components should have stories but some might
not be fully functional or might not best represent the current state of the component.

## Todos:
Search the stories for `@TODO` to find some remaining todos.
Beyond the stated todos, stories.js files can be improved by adding more stories, or by adding a `.mdx` docs page like
this one to better describe and demonstrate a components features

## Noteworthy stuff:
- [`Breadcrumb` has an example MDX docs page](?path=/docs/basics-breadcrumb--docs)
- [`Icon` has an `autodocs` docs page](?path=/docs/basics-icon--docs)
- `ConcreteAjaxSelect` shows how to use [`MSW`](https://storybook.js.org/addons/msw-storybook-addon) to mock http
requests


## Working on storybook
The main files controlling storybook are:
- `/.storybook/assets/main.js` Overall configuration for storybook
- `/.storybook/assets/preview.js` Configuration for the frame stories are rendered in. Use this file to add global
things to `window` for example.
