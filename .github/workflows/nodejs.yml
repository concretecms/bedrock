# This workflow will do a clean install of node dependencies, build the source code and run tests across different versions of node
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-nodejs-with-github-actions

# IMPORTANT: We're using `npm i` below even though `npm ci` is faster. 
# We have to do this because npm is stupid about how it installs its dependencies
# in certain contexts. Basically any time I (andrew) would run npm i locally
# the bootstrap-tourist entry in package-lock.json is overwritten with my local "fetch it
# from SSH!" functionality, because I have ssh configured. Then when we push it here
# the pipeline breaks. By changing this to run with npm i this no longer breaks.
# For a long discussion of this, along with npm's broken default behavior, see here:
# https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2610
